# A_CRM_Application_to_Manage_the_Services_offered_by_an_Institution


The EduConsultPro Institute is one of these leading educational institutes that 
annually presents a greater quantity of various courses and programs for an 
increasing quantity of prospective students. The service standards need effective 
management in admissions management, student inquiries, and expert 
consulting to keep them in a high position. This project will entail the design and 
implementation of a comprehensive CRM application using Salesforce to 
support this process better and improve the experience of students and 
admissions staff alike. The solution will consist of features in admission 
application management, consulting services management, and immigration 
case management, among others. Admission Application Management will 
enable prospects to make applications online and for the admission staff to trace 
and scrutinize the applications through automated notifications. Consulting 
Services Management will help students create their request for expert advice, 
while consultants can schedule and manage their appointments with much ease. 
The Immigration Case Management will provide information on immigration- 
related questions and cases. Some features of this system include automated 
workflows, email notifications, comprehensive dashboards, and collaboration 
tools. EduConsultPro Institute has now revamped pages for their prospective 
students, which are smooth, transparent, and easily navigated, all made possible 
through the use of Salesforce CRM. The sole concept, however, is developing 
operational efficiencies with an increased throughput in the admission process 
through consulting services. Now, this project aligns not just with things up front 
but provides a nice platform for scalable and future-fit growth. 

The project will involve: 
 - Developing a user-friendly admission application system that allows 
prospective students to apply online, with automated notifications and 
detailed reporting for admissions staff. - Creating an efficient approval workflow for consulting requests, including 
automated email alerts and a streamlined submission process. - Managing consulting services by enabling students to request 
consultations, schedule appointments, and track service statuses within 
Salesforce. - Handling immigration cases by allowing students to initiate cases through 
multiple channels, manage documents, and track case progress with 
integrated tools. 
 
Include the likes of setup of Salesforce objects, development of custom flows, 
designing for unified app pages, and more in lightning. These changes should 
be targeted at bringing a clearer and more smooth experience for the 
concerned users who are going through the processes of admission and 
consultation.
